# OnePieceSpoilerBot
An email bot using Gmail and Reddits APIs, designed to scan a subreddit to inform fans of potential spoilers about the japanese comic series One Piece.

The program does not include the email sender or emailpassword and the client id or client secret as those numbers are meant as a passowrd for me. The original emails.txt file used for the reminder is also not included to protect the identity of the fans who are on the list to recieve spoiler checks.
